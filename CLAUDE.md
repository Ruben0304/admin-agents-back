This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Purpose

This is an **Admin System for Virtual Assistants Management** designed to provide centralized, plug & play administration of AI assistants across multiple applications.

### Core Functionality

The system enables you to:

- **Manage Multiple Apps**: Create and manage different applications (e.g., "App1", "App2") each with their own virtual assistants
- **Configure Assistants Per App**: Each app can have multiple assistants (e.g., "Assistant 1", "Assistant 2") with independent configurations
- **Dynamic Model Selection**: Change LLM providers and models through an admin panel without code modifications:
  - Switch between providers (Gemini, Cohere, OpenAI, etc.)
  - Select specific models within each provider (e.g., gemini-2.5-pro, command-r, gpt-4)
- **Dynamic Provider Creation**: Create custom LLM providers with Python code through admin interface:
  - Code templates for popular providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
  - Real-time validation and testing framework
  - Secure code execution environment
  - Template-based provider setup with configuration schemas
- **System Prompt Management**: Customize system prompts for each assistant through the admin interface
- **API Key Management**: Configure API keys for different providers through the admin panel
- **Zero-Code Configuration**: All changes are made through the admin interface, requiring no code deployments

### Use Case Example

1. Create "App1" with "Customer Support Assistant" and "Sales Assistant"
2. Configure Customer Support to use Gemini with a helpful support prompt
3. Configure Sales Assistant to use Cohere with a persuasive sales prompt
4. Switch providers/models instantly through the admin panel as needed
5. Add API keys for new providers without touching code

This architecture provides maximum flexibility for managing AI assistants across different applications with complete configuration control.

## Project Architecture

This is a FastAPI backend application structured following a layered architecture pattern with **PostgreSQL database integration**:

- **`main.py`** - FastAPI application entry point with direct router inclusion:
  ```python
  # Core routers
  app.include_router(auth.router)
  app.include_router(chat.router)
  app.include_router(admin.router)
  
  # Assistant-specific routers
  app.include_router(assistants.suncar_router)
  app.include_router(assistants.moneytracker_router)
  ```
- **`models/`** - Pydantic models for request/response schemas and database operations
- **`routers/`** - FastAPI route handlers organized by functionality:
  - `/auth` - Authentication endpoints with JWT token management
  - `/admin` - Comprehensive admin panel for managing all system entities
  - `/chat` - Chat endpoints for assistant interactions (database-backed)
  - **`assistants/`** - Specialized routers for dedicated assistant endpoints:
    - `/suncar/` - Suncar automotive assistant with specialized endpoints
    - `/moneytracker/` - MoneyTracker financial assistant with specialized endpoints
- **`services/`** - Business logic layer with database-backed authentication
- **`providers/`** - LLM provider implementations with factory pattern for multiple AI services
- **`assistants/`** - Pre-built AI assistant implementations with specialized functionality
- **`repositories/`** - Modular database operations layer:
  - `user_repository.py` - User CRUD operations
  - `application_repository.py` - Application CRUD operations
  - `provider_repository.py` - Provider CRUD operations
  - `model_repository.py` - Model CRUD operations
  - `assistant_repository.py` - Assistant CRUD operations
  - `api_key_repository.py` - API Key CRUD operations
- **`database/`** - PostgreSQL database layer:
  - `models.py` - SQLAlchemy database models
  - `database.py` - Database connection and session management

## Database Architecture

The system uses PostgreSQL with the following main tables:

### Repository Layer Architecture

The system implements a **modular repository pattern** for clean separation of database operations:

```
repositories/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py                    # Exports all repository functions
â”œâ”€â”€ user_repository.py             # User CRUD operations
â”œâ”€â”€ application_repository.py      # Application CRUD operations
â”œâ”€â”€ provider_repository.py         # Provider CRUD operations
â”œâ”€â”€ model_repository.py            # Model CRUD operations
â”œâ”€â”€ assistant_repository.py        # Assistant CRUD operations
â””â”€â”€ api_key_repository.py          # API Key CRUD operations
```

**Benefits of Repository Pattern**:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each entity has its own repository file
- **Maintainability**: Easy to locate and modify specific database operations
- **Testability**: Individual repositories can be tested in isolation
- **Scalability**: New repositories can be added without affecting existing ones
- **Clean Imports**: Single import statement provides access to all operations

**Usage**:

```python
from repositories import *

# All repository functions are available
user = get_user_by_username(db, "admin")
assistant = get_assistant_by_name(db, "Suncar")
applications = get_applications(db)
```

### Core Tables

### Authentication System

The system uses **database-backed JWT authentication** with:

- Secure password hashing using bcrypt
- JWT tokens with expiration (30 minutes default)
- Role-based access control (admin/regular users)
- **Default credentials**: `admin / password123` and `user1 / user123`

## LLM Providers Architecture

The project uses a factory pattern for LLM providers organized by company with **full async support**:

```
providers/
â”œâ”€â”€ llm_provider.py          # Abstract base class for all providers (async)
â”œâ”€â”€ llm_factory.py           # Factory for creating provider instances
â”œâ”€â”€ google/                  # Google AI services
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ gemini_provider.py   # Gemini async implementation (uses asyncio.to_thread)
â””â”€â”€ cohere/                  # Cohere AI services
    â””â”€â”€ cohere_provider.py   # Cohere async implementation (uses AsyncClientV2)
```

### Key Features

- **Fully Async**: All providers implement async methods for non-blocking operations
- **System Prompts**: Support for system prompts to define AI assistant roles and behavior
- **Provider-Specific Implementation**:
  - **Cohere**: Uses native `AsyncClientV2` for true async operations
  - **Gemini**: Uses `asyncio.to_thread()` to wrap sync operations asynchronously

### Usage Examples

```python
from providers import chat_with_llm, LLMFactory
import asyncio

async def main():
    # Chat with any provider (async)
    response = await chat_with_llm("gemini", "gemini-2.5-pro", "Hello", streaming=False)

    # Chat with system prompt
    response = await chat_with_llm(
        "cohere",
        "command-r",
        "What can you help me with?",
        system_prompt="You are a helpful programming assistant specialized in Python.",
        streaming=True,
        api_key="optional"
    )

    # List available providers (sync method)
    print(LLMFactory.get_available_providers())  # ["gemini", "cohere"]

    # Register new providers (sync method)
    LLMFactory.register_provider("openai", OpenAIProvider)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### System Prompt Support

All providers now support system prompts to define the AI assistant's role:

```python
# Example with system prompt
response = await chat_with_llm(
    provider_name="gemini",
    model="gemini-2.5-pro",
    prompt="How do I optimize this code?",
    system_prompt="You are an expert software engineer specializing in performance optimization.",
    streaming=False
)
```

## Assistants Architecture

The project includes pre-built AI assistants with specialized functionality organized in a modular structure:

```
assistants/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py                           # Exports for easy importing
â”œâ”€â”€ base_assistant.py                     # Abstract base class for all assistants
â”œâ”€â”€ MoneyTracker/                         # Personal finance assistant
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ moneytracker.py                   # Core MoneyTracker assistant class
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ moneytracker_chatbot_service.py  # Service with specialized finance features
â””â”€â”€ Suncar/                              # Automotive assistant
    â”œâ”€â”€ suncar.py                         # Core Suncar assistant class
    â””â”€â”€ suncar_chatbot_service.py         # Service with specialized automotive features
```

### Database-First Architecture

**IMPORTANT**: All assistants now load their configuration (system prompt, streaming settings, provider, model, API keys) from the PostgreSQL database. Only the user's message prompt is provided dynamically.

### Base Assistant Class

All assistants inherit from `BaseAssistant` which provides:

- **Database Integration**: Load all configuration from PostgreSQL database
- **LLM Integration**: Seamless integration with the LLM providers
- **System Prompt Management**: System prompts loaded from database
- **Async Chat**: Non-blocking conversation capabilities
- **Provider Flexibility**: Works with any registered LLM provider
- **Dual Initialization**: Support for both database loading and manual configuration

### Available Assistants

### Usage Examples

#### Option 1: Load Assistant from Database (Recommended)

```python
from assistants import MoneyTracker, Suncar, BaseAssistant
from database.database import get_db
import asyncio

async def main():
    db = next(get_db())

    # Load MoneyTracker assistant from database by ID
    # This gets ALL configuration from DB: system prompt, provider, model, streaming, API key
    money_tracker = MoneyTracker(assistant_id=1, db=db)

    # Chat using database configuration
    response = await money_tracker.chat("What's the best way to save for retirement?")

    # Load Suncar assistant from database
    suncar = Suncar(assistant_id=2, db=db)

    # Chat with database-configured assistant
    response = await suncar.chat("When should I change my oil?")

    # Alternative: Use BaseAssistant directly
    assistant = BaseAssistant.from_database(assistant_id=1, db=db)
    response = await assistant.chat("Hello!")

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Option 2: Manual Configuration (Legacy Support)

```python
from assistants import MoneyTracker, Suncar
import asyncio

async def main():
    # Still supported for backwards compatibility
    money_tracker = MoneyTracker(
        llm_provider="gemini",
        model="gemini-2.5-pro",
        api_key="your-api-key",
        streaming=False
    )

    response = await money_tracker.chat("Help me with budgeting")

    suncar = Suncar(
        llm_provider="cohere",
        model="command-r",
        api_key="your-api-key",
        streaming=True
    )

    response = await suncar.chat("Car maintenance tips?")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Creating New Assistants

To create a new assistant:

1. **Create assistant folder**: `assistants/NewAssistant/`
2. **Implement core class**: Inherit from `BaseAssistant`
3. **Create service class**: Add specialized methods and features
4. **Define system prompt**: Specify the assistant's expertise and personality
5. **Update exports**: Add to `assistants/__init__.py`

Example structure:

```python
class NewAssistant(BaseAssistant):
    def __init__(self, llm_provider: str, model: str, api_key: Optional[str] = None):
        default_prompt = "You are a specialist in..."
        super().__init__(
            name="NewAssistant",
            llm_provider=llm_provider,
            model=model,
            default_system_prompt=default_prompt,
            api_key=api_key
        )
```

## Common Commands

3. **Specialized Functionality**: Endpoints tailored to each assistant's expertise
4. **Database Integration**: All configuration loaded from PostgreSQL database
5. **Authentication**: JWT-based security for all endpoints
6. **Modular Design**: Easy to add new assistants and endpoints

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Suncar Automotive Assistant
POST /suncar/maintenance-schedule
{
    "vehicle_make": "Toyota",
    "vehicle_model": "Corolla",
    "year": 2020,
    "current_mileage": 45000
}

# MoneyTracker Financial Assistant
POST /moneytracker/budget-advice
{
    "monthly_income": 3000,
    "monthly_expenses": 2200,
    "financial_goals": "Save for vacation",
    "current_savings": 1500,
    "debt_amount": 5000,
    "age": 28
}
```

### Adding New Assistant Routers

To create a new assistant router:

1. **Create router file**: `routers/assistants/new_assistant_router.py`
2. **Implement endpoints**: Add specialized functionality for the assistant
3. **Update main.py**: Include the new router
4. **Update **init**.py**: Export the router

Example structure:

```python
router = APIRouter(prefix="/newassistant", tags=["NewAssistant"])

@router.post("/chat")
async def chat_with_assistant(request: AssistantChatRequest):
    # Implementation here
    pass

@router.post("/specialized-feature")
async def specialized_feature(request: dict):
    # Specialized functionality here
    pass
```

## Legacy Application-Specific Router Architecture

The system previously implemented **dynamic application-specific routers** that create dedicated endpoints for each application and its assistants. This provides clean, organized API access for each application independently.

### Router Structure

For each application in the database, the system automatically generates:

- **Application Router**: Main router for the application (`/app/{app_name}/`)
- **Assistant Endpoints**: Individual chat endpoints for each assistant within the application

### URL Pattern Examples

```
/app/ecommerce/                          # Main application endpoint
/app/ecommerce/customer-support          # Customer Support Assistant chat
/app/ecommerce/sales-assistant           # Sales Assistant chat
/app/ecommerce/product-helper            # Product Helper Assistant chat

### Implementation Architecture

#### Router Factory Pattern

```python
# routers/app_factory.py
class ApplicationRouterFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_application_router(app_name: str, assistants: List[Assistant]) -> APIRouter:
        """Creates a dedicated router for an application with all its assistant endpoints"""

    @staticmethod
    def create_assistant_endpoint(assistant: Assistant) -> Callable:
        """Creates individual chat endpoint for a specific assistant"""
```

#### Dynamic Router Registration

```python
# main.py - Application startup
async def setup_application_routers():
    """Dynamically registers routers for all applications in the database"""
    db = next(get_db())
    applications = get_all_applications(db)

    for app in applications:
        # Create router for this application
        app_router = ApplicationRouterFactory.create_application_router(
            app_name=app.name,
            assistants=app.assistants
        )

        # Register router with FastAPI
        main_app.include_router(
            app_router,
            prefix=f"/app/{app.name.lower().replace(' ', '-')}",
            tags=[f"App: {app.name}"]
        )
```

### Assistant Chat Endpoints

Each assistant gets its own dedicated chat endpoint with the following structure:

#### Endpoint Format

```
POST /app/{app_name}/{assistant_name}
```

#### Request/Response Models

```python
# Chat with specific assistant
class AssistantChatRequest(BaseModel):
    message: str
    stream: Optional[bool] = None  # Override assistant's default streaming setting

class AssistantChatResponse(BaseModel):
    response: str
    assistant_name: str
    application: str
    timestamp: datetime
    provider_used: str
    model_used: str
```

#### Example API Calls

```bash
# Chat with Customer Support Assistant in E-Commerce app
POST /app/ecommerce/customer-support
{
    "message": "I need help with my order",
    "stream": false
}

# Chat with Account Manager in Banking app
POST /app/banking/account-manager
{
    "message": "What's my account balance?",
    "stream": true
}
```

### Authentication & Authorization

Application-specific routers maintain the same authentication requirements:

- **JWT Token Required**: All assistant chat endpoints require valid authentication
- **Application Access Control**: Users can be restricted to specific applications
- **Assistant-Level Permissions**: Fine-grained control over which assistants users can access

### Dynamic Router Updates

The system supports **hot-reloading** of application routers:

- **Database Changes**: When applications or assistants are added/modified through admin panel
- **Automatic Re-registration**: System detects changes and updates routes without restart
- **Zero Downtime**: New assistants become available immediately

### Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Clean API Organization**: Each application has its own namespace
2. **Intuitive URLs**: Easy to understand and remember endpoint patterns
3. **Scalable Structure**: Add new applications without code changes
4. **Independent Configuration**: Each assistant endpoint uses its own database configuration
5. **Automatic Documentation**: FastAPI automatically generates docs for all dynamic endpoints
6. **Version Control**: Applications can have different API versions if needed

### Usage in Client Applications

Client applications can easily integrate with their dedicated endpoints:

```javascript
// E-Commerce application client code
const chatWithSupport = async (message) => {
  const response = await fetch("/app/ecommerce/customer-support", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ message, stream: false }),
  });
  return response.json();
};

// Banking application client code
const chatWithAccountManager = async (message) => {
  const response = await fetch("/app/banking/account-manager", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ message, stream: true }),
  });
  return response.json();
};
```
